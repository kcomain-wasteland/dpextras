# dpextras
opinionated discord.py extension containing some utility functions for stuff

Constructive criticisms are welcome :)

Note that this module is not meant for public use and contain tailored features that I deem important to use in my bots.

Somewhat stable code should reside in the `master` branch. The `develop` branch contains code that might break.

I am aware of the millions of other repos that probably do things that I do here already, but I'm the kind of person
that does stupid useless things.
